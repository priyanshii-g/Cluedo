We intend to make a digitalized version of the popular mystery board game- Cluedo. It is a turn-based murder-mystery game. 
Dr. Black invited you and five other people to his mansion for dinner but       blackmailed you all into supporting his nefarious scheme. Later that night, he is found  dead! Dive into the murder mystery and be the first to figure out the murderer, the murder weapon and the crime room.
Cluedo is a turn-based murder-mystery game where the objective of the players is to find who murdered Mr. Black, using which weapon and where it took place. There will be three categories of cards: Weapon, Suspect and Room.
Players will deduce that by gathering clues by asking questions. They will be provided with a CHECKLIST to help them in deduction. Clues are gathered by asking questions and making suggestions. Players use a dice to move around the board and get to a room where they will get to make a suggestion. When a suggestion is made, the player reveals a combination which he finds is correct. Then, the player on the left reveals one card if they have any of the cards mentioned. Then they update their checklist accordingly and cross out the possibilities. This will continue until someone makes the right accusation by selecting the correct combination and is able to find the murderer.
By eliminating possibilities, players narrow down the suspects until they are able to identify the murderer successfully. Strategize and navigate through the clues and come up with the right combination before anyone else does. That's how you WIN the game. Remember, even though you can make as many number suggestions, you can only make one accusation which would be the deciding factor of whether you WIN or are OUT. So pay attention to the clues andâ€¦
Good Luck, Sherlock!
